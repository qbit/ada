Ada is a XMPP bot that hangs out in the 'codez' room on
[enlighten.im](enlighten.im) and watches for codes.  When she see's one
she fires off [pushover.net](pushover.net) notifications to all her
faithful users.

Once you have your [enlighten.im](enlighten.im) account, simply add
ada@enlighten.im as a buddy and send her a message, she will give you
further instructions from there.
